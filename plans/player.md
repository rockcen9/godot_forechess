# Player Implementation Plan

## Overview
Spawn a player with soldier sprite at grid position 3,3 on the existing chess board.

## Stage 1: Create Player Scene
**Goal**: Create a Player scene with sprite and positioning functionality
**Success Criteria**: Player.tscn exists with Sprite2D node and script for grid positioning
**Status**: Complete

- Create Player.tscn scene with Node2D root
- Add Sprite2D child node
- Create player.gd script with grid positioning logic
- Set soldier sprite texture from assets/units/player/soldier.png

## Stage 2: Implement Grid Positioning System
**Goal**: Add methods to position player on board grid coordinates
**Success Criteria**: Player can be positioned at any grid coordinate and converts to correct pixel position
**Status**: Complete

- Add setup() method to position player at grid coordinates
- Follow existing tile positioning pattern (x * 64, y * 64)
- Add grid_x and grid_y properties to track position

## Stage 3: Integrate Player with BoardManager
**Goal**: Spawn player through BoardManager at specified grid position
**Success Criteria**: Player appears at grid position 3,3 when game starts
**Status**: Complete

- Add player spawning method to BoardManager
- Instantiate player scene and position at 3,3
- Add player to scene tree as child of BoardManager

## Stage 4: Test and Verify Position
**Goal**: Confirm player appears at correct visual position on board
**Success Criteria**: Player sprite is centered on tile at row 3, column 3
**Status**: Complete

- Run game and verify player appears at expected location
- Ensure sprite is properly centered on tile
- Verify grid coordinates match visual position

## Questions/Clarifications Needed:

1. **Grid coordinate system**: Should position 3,3 be interpreted as (row 3, column 3) or (x=3, y=3)? In typical game coordinates, this could mean different things.

2. **Player size**: Should the soldier sprite fill the entire tile (64x64) or be smaller? Any specific scaling requirements?

3. **Layer ordering**: Should the player appear above or below the board tiles? This affects the scene tree structure.

4. **Future expansion**: Will there be multiple players or pieces? This might influence the architecture choices.

## Technical Notes:
- Existing board uses 8x8 grid with 64x64 pixel tiles
- Board is centered on screen via BoardManager.center_board()
- Soldier sprite already exists at `assets/units/player/soldier.png`
- Following existing patterns from BoardTile implementation
