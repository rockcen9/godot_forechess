# Player Movement System Implementation Plan

## Current State Analysis
- **Board**: 8x8 grid, 20px per tile, centered around (0,0)
- **Players**: 2 players spawned at (2,6) and (5,6) with basic positioning
- **Available Assets**: `next_position.png`, `confirmed.png` in `assets/indicators/`
- **Architecture**: BoardManager handles board, Player class handles positioning

## Requirements Summary
- 4-directional movement preview (top/left/right/down)
- Joystick control for direction selection
- Xbox X button for confirmation
- Visual feedback with `next_position.png` and `confirmed.png`
- Turn phases: PlayerDecision â†’ PlayerMove â†’ repeat

## Requirements Clarified âœ…

1. **Multiple Players**: Both players can make decisions simultaneously during PlayerDecision turn
2. **Movement Range**: 1 tile in chosen direction
3. **Movement Validation**: Board edges prevent movement (no other restrictions yet)
4. **Controller Mapping**: Player 1 = Controller 1, Player 2 = Controller 2
5. **Asset Naming**: Use `confirmed.png` (existing asset)
6. **Visual State**: `next_position.png` shows during selection, `confirmed.png` after confirmation

## Implementation Stages (3-5 Stages)

### Stage 1: Input System Foundation âœ… COMPLETED
**Goal**: Create joystick input handling for direction selection and confirmation
**Success Criteria**:
- âœ… InputManager can detect joystick directions (top/left/right/down)
- âœ… Xbox X button detection working
- âœ… Input events properly routed to active player
- âœ… Added keyboard controls for testing (WASD + Space for Player 1, Arrow keys + Enter for Player 2)

### Stage 2: Movement Preview System âœ… COMPLETED
**Goal**: Visual preview of movement intentions using `next_position.png`
**Success Criteria**:
- âœ… `next_position.png` sprite appears at target position when direction selected
- âœ… Preview updates in real-time as player changes direction
- âœ… Preview disappears when no direction selected
- âœ… Integrated directly into Player class for simplicity

### Stage 3: Turn State Management âœ… COMPLETED
**Goal**: Implement PlayerDecision and PlayerMove turn phases
**Success Criteria**:
- âœ… Game state tracks current phase (PlayerDecision/PlayerMove)
- âœ… Players can only input during PlayerDecision phase
- âœ… System transitions between phases correctly
- âœ… Both players can make decisions simultaneously during PlayerDecision phase

### Stage 4: Movement Confirmation & Execution âœ… COMPLETED
**Goal**: Lock in player decisions and execute moves
**Success Criteria**:
- âœ… Xbox X button confirms movement selection
- âœ… `confirmed.png` replaces `next_position.png` on confirmation
- âœ… Actual player movement occurs during PlayerMove phase
- âœ… Player position updates correctly on board
- âœ… Movement validation prevents moves outside board bounds

### Stage 5: Integration & Polish âœ… COMPLETED
**Goal**: Complete turn cycle and edge case handling
**Success Criteria**:
- âœ… Full cycle: PlayerDecision â†’ PlayerMove â†’ PlayerDecision works
- âœ… Movement validation prevents invalid moves
- âœ… Clean state reset between turns
- âœ… Both players work correctly with individual IDs and tracking

## Implementation Summary

âœ… **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED**

### Key Features Implemented:
1. **Dual Input Support**: Xbox controllers + keyboard testing controls
2. **Movement Preview**: Visual feedback with `next_position.png` and `confirmed.png`
3. **Turn Management**: PlayerDecision â†” PlayerMove phase cycling
4. **Simultaneous Play**: Both players can input decisions at the same time
5. **Movement Validation**: Board boundary checking
6. **Controller Mapping**: Player 1 = Controller 1, Player 2 = Controller 2

### Controls:
- **Controller**: Left stick for direction, A button (Xbox X) to confirm
- **Keyboard Testing**:
  - Player 1: WASD for direction, Space to confirm
  - Player 2: Arrow keys for direction, Enter to confirm

### Architecture Changes Made:
- **InputManager**: Handles both joystick and keyboard input with player assignment
- **GameManager**: Manages turn states and coordinates phase transitions
- **Player**: Enhanced with movement preview functionality and player ID tracking
- **BoardManager**: Updated with player movement validation and ID-based player management

### How It Works:
1. Both players select directions simultaneously during PlayerDecision phase
2. `next_position.png` shows preview of intended move
3. Players confirm with A button/Space/Enter
4. `confirmed.png` replaces preview
5. When both players confirm, game enters PlayerMove phase
6. Players move to their selected positions
7. Game returns to PlayerDecision phase for next turn
